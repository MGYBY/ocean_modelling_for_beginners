DATA OUTPUT

Data outputs consist of time, location and vertical velocity.  

SPECIFIC FORTRAN COMMAND USED

The statement WRITE(10,'(4F12.4)') specifies an output format.  This output goes to unit 10, defined before, with four numbers
each of 12 digits with 4 digits after the decimal point.  

The command REAL() converts an integer into a real number.  You can do it the other way around with the INTEGER() statement. 

The function MIN(a,b) takes the smallest of two real numbers, whereas MAX(a,b) takes the greater of the two numbers.  

USE OF A FUNCTION

The main program calls a function "density" defined after the main code as to calculate the density of the ambient ocean at the location of the object. 
Functions commence with REAL FUNCTION name and finish with END FUNCTION name.  The function is called in the main program by a statement "c = density(a,b)",
where values of the parameters a and b have been specified beforehand.  The function returns its calculation to the parameter c.  In this exercise,
input parameters for this function are actual vertical location and stability frequency.  This function returns a real value and has two input parameters
that, within the function, carry the names "zin" and "N2in".  These parameters are declared as local parameters with "REAL, INTENT(IN)::" statements.  
Functions don't have access to parameters defined in the main program (unless using so-called modules, which will be explained later on).  
This is the reason why we have to declare and specify the parameter g (acceleration due to gravity) again.
