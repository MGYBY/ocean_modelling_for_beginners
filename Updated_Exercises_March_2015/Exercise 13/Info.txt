Note: This code does not include prediction of Eulerian
tracer fields.

Since the advection equation is applied several times for
different purposed in the simulation code, the advection
scheme is implemented in the code in generalised form as a
subroutine called "advect".  

Input tor this subroutine are Courant numbers and an array
"B", representing either u, v, or h.  The subroutine returns
an array "BN" of the advective change of B per time step
excluding the last term on the right-hand side of (5.21).
This subroutine calls the "PSI" function that calculates
coefficients with respect to the value of the "MODE"
parameter chosen.

The arrays B, BN, CuP, CuN, CvP, CvN, Cu and Cv and the
parameter MODE need to be declared in the "param" module as
global parameters.  


The sea-level predictor requires special treatment.  
The important differences here with respect to the treatment
of the nonlinear terms are that 

a) the Courant numbers are based on newly predicted
velocity component, and 

b) the last term on the right-hand side of (5.21) must not
be included.
