Wind-stress forcing, bottom and lateral friction, the
nonlinear terms and the beta-plane approximation are disabled. 

The density anomaly between the layers is gradually adjusted
to its final value over the initial 2 days of the simulation.
This is done in the main code within the iteration loop. 

The simulation code includes prediction of Lagrangian
tracers that are initially located in different regions
defined by concentric circle segments.  A total of 400
Lagrangian floats are added to each model layer. 
Initilisation of these floats requires the random-number
creator formulated in "random.f95".  Float predictions
commence after 2 days of simulation.

There are three animation scripts. "Doming.sce" produces an
animation of the shape of the density interface.  The other
scripts produce graphs of float trajectories and final flow
field in the top and bottom layers, respectively.
