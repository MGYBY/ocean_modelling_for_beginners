
+++++ FORTRAN +++++

The FORTRAN simulation code is very similar to that of
Exercise 6.  Apart from having two-dimensional horizontal
arrays, nothing much has changed. 
 
The main program calls all the subroutines.  It now contains
output of data blocks of 51 by 51 elements in size.  
The entire output of a variable, such as sea-level elevation,
goes into a single file.  

+++++ SciLab +++++

The script does neither include axis labels nor a title.  
I am sure that you - the reader - are now experienced enough
to alter the script according to your needs.
