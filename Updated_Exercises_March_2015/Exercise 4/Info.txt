The switch MODE is used to select either the semi-implicit scheme or the local-rotation scheme. Remember that, in contrast to SciLab scripts, 
each line in a FORTRAN code can only have one equation.

+++++ SciLAB +++++

All the SciLab script does is to animate data predicted by the FORTRAN model code.  The first line of the input file contains information on
rotation rate, time step, and number of frames of the animation, so that we don't need to refine the SciLab script when changing settings in
the FORTRAN code.  Note that SciLab scripts are case sensitive.
