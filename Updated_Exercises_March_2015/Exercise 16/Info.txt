The bathymetry file "topo.dat" must be supplied in local
folder. Lateral momentum diffusion/lateral friction is not
included in the codes.

The folder "Case 1" contains the codes for the case of
Rossby-wave disturbances travelling in the same direction
as the ambient flow.

Additional treatment is required to avoid problems at
lateral boundaries.

1) Strong bottom friction is used near the downstream
   (eastern) boundary. This is only applied to velocity
   fluctuations not the true velocity.

2) Sea-level fluctuations are filtered away near the
   upstream (western) boundary. 

The folder "Case 2" contains the codes for the case of
Rossby-wave disturbances travelling against the direction
of the ambient flow.  To avoid problems at boundaries,
sea-level anomalies are filtered away near the downstream
(eastern) boundary.  Use of a zone of enhanced bottom
friction is not required.
