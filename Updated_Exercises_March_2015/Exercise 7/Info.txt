
+++++ FORTRAN +++++

As in Exercise 6, the FORTRAN code consists of three files:
the main code, a declaration module and a module containing
subroutines.  The declaration module lists all parameters
and arrays accessed by the main program and the subroutines.

The variables in this exercise are two-dimensional arrays
with the first index i being the layer number and the second
index k being the grid index.  Grid indices of 0 and nx+1
mark the lateral boundaries of the model domain.  

Output of all layer thicknesses goes into a single file.
The output comes thus in blocks of 10 lines and 101 columns,
whereby lines correspond to layer numbers and columns refer
to grid cells in the horizontal.  Output of lateral
velocities has the same structure.  In addition to this,
there is an output of initial layer thicknesses to the file
"h0.dat".  The file "header.txt" contains additional information, such
as output time steps.  

As before, I saved the main code with the file name
"main.f95", the declaration module as "param.f95", and the
module with the subroutines as "sub.f95".  

The source code can be  compiled in the Command Prompt
window with:

g95 main.f95 param.f95 sub.f95

At times, you have to do this twice. As before, I kept all
files for Exercise 7 in a single folder including the SciLab
animation script.  Double-clicking the latter opens SciLab
in the right directory where it finds the relevant input files.
