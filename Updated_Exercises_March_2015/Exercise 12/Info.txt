******************************************************
IMPORTANT INFORMATION

This code requires the files "uF.dat", "vf.dat", and
"h0.dat" from Exercise 10 as input data.
*******************************************************

The main program calls a random-number generator, being
defined in a new module called ``random''.  The record
length parameter "recl" in the OPEN statements is required
to be able to create large files with many (3000 here)
numbers in each line. 

Tracer locations are based on the point-of-origin at
the water depth (h) grid point at j = 1 and k = 1.
Velocity in vicinity of a float is approximated by the
velocity interpolated to the nearest h grid point.

In addition to output data from the FORTRAN program, the
code requires the file "h0.dat" from Exercise 10.  
Copy this into the local folder!
