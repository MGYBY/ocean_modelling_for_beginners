The main code "main.f95" contains the simulation loop,
calls subroutines and produces the output. 

I decided to produce outputs of sea-level elevation
and horizontal speed at time intervals of 2 s.  

Output of vertical speed calculated at a depth of 5 m below
the sea surface is added for the creation of velocity stickplots.

The switch MODE selects either the dam-break scenario or
the wave-paddle forcing. 

+++++ SciLab +++++

The SciLab animation script only displays the right half
of the channel, given that the experimental design should
trigger symmetric dynamics about the channel's centre.
Nevertheless, before running this script, you should verify
your results are symmetric as well. If not, this symmetry
test has revealed programming errors in your code. 

The SciLab script calls a "champ" drawing a two-dimensional
vector field as arrows of length in proportion to the
intensity of the field.
