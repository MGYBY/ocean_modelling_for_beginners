Wind-stress forcing, bottom and lateral friction, and the
beta-plane approximation are disabled. Adjustment is not
used in this exercise. Lagrangian float predictions are not
included in the code.

There are four different animation scripts. "SurfaceFlow.sce"
and "BottomFlow.sce" produces animations of currents and
tracer distributions in the surface and bottom layers,
respectively. "Interface.sce" creates an animation of the
evolution of interface displacements. "BenthicStorms.sce"
reveals low-pressure centres in the bottom layer driving
benthic storms.
